Welcome to my first coded website.
I changed a few minor things from the original design, like dropping the social media buttons and a more simpler version of the home page carousel.
I changed the header H1 font from Caveat to Papyrus, since the second is more commonly used.
I followed a youtube tutorial from CodingNepal on how to create a responsive hamburger menu. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkK8yHC4TlI
I found the code for the text fontface on https://www.onlinewebfonts.com/download/8dbb836081059e0f2e81eeeaec207c19
